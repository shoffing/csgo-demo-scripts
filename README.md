# inferno-damage-parser
Reads CS:GO demo files and extracts all damage dealt during the matches.

Put demo files in /demos/, then run extract_damage.js. This generates a JSON file containing all the damage dealt in the demos.
Then run render_damage.js to render an SVG from the generated JSON file.

See inferno_damage_dealt.svg for example output.
